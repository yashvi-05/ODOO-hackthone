WeWear is a web platform designed to promote sustainability in the clothing industry by enabling people to swap and recycle their unused clothes. Users can list wearable garments on the platform for others to browse and swap directly. The platform features a clean, responsive interface with user authentication, dashboards showing swaps, real-time item tracking, and an admin panel to ensure quality control. This not only extends the life of wearable clothes but also builds a community-driven sharing economy, reducing textile waste effectively.

For clothes that are no longer wearable, WeWear connects users with NGOs that recycle fabric into rugs and other products. Users can donate these unusable garments through the platform, and in return — after meeting a specified quantity — they receive recycled rugs as incentives. This integrated recycling feature ensures even damaged clothes are diverted from landfills and put to good use, minimizing waste and maximizing sustainability in a circular economy.
